# 🗂️🩺⚜️ Dossier Médical Centralisé Québec (Quebec Centralized Medical Record System)

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a centralized medical record system for the Quebec healthcare system. The software will allow users of the Quebec health system to have a centralized medical record, regardless of the doctor or healthcare facility they visit.

## 📖🧠 Context

Currently, each doctor's office and hospital maintains its own patient records. In most cases, these records are never shared, preventing doctors from having a comprehensive view of a patient's health status. This system is designed to address this problem by centralizing patient medical records.

##  Key Features

- Centralized patient medical records
- Access for healthcare providers to a patient's complete medical history
- Record of patient visits across different healthcare facilities
- Comprehensive view of known diagnoses
- Information on other doctors treating the patient

## Benefits

- Improved continuity of care
- Enhanced decision-making for healthcare providers
- Reduced redundancy in medical tests and procedures
- Better coordination among different healthcare providers
